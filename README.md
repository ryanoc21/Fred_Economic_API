# Fred_Economic_API
This project takes Irish Economic data from the Fred API. The data are imported to a jupyter notebook where they are cleaned and written to csv files. 
The csv files are read to a python file where they are represented in a streamlit web app. The methods in use in the web app are developed in a 
Data Processing class contained in the backend.py file.
